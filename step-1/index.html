        <h1>Zooming and Panning</h1>

        <p>
          Try scrolling around in the diagram to the right.  Hold the Ctrl key while scrolling
          to zoom in and out.  On mobile/tablet, use two-finger scroll to pan and pinch-to-zoom.

        <h2>Virtual DOM</h2>

        <p>
          We start with a discussion about using a virtual DOM library.  I think this by
          far the easiest way to implement a zoomable UI, or really any highly interactive
          browser-based UI.
        </p>

        <p>
          To implement an interactive UI you really need to render your UI in two different ways.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Render all your HTML when the UI is first displayed.
          <li>As the user interacts with your UI, tweak various parts of the DOM accordingly.
        </ul>

        <p>
          It's that second part that really gets difficult when your UI increases
          in complexity.  You <em>could</em> just re-render the inner HTML of
          your root element every time but this is too slow and would look
          terrible.  A virtual DOM (vDOM) library allows you to just do the first part,
          and let the library worry about the second part.  The trick is to build
          a JavaScript data structure (the virtual DOM) that matches your desired
          HTML/DOM structure and let the virtual DOM library make the minimal
          changes required to the actual browser DOM match.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this tutorial we use <a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a>, but you can use React or
          whatever vDOM library you're comfortable with.  For something super lightweight you
          can try <a href="https://github.com/lazamar/smvc">SMVC</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The application life-cycle looks something like this.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>We start with a data structure called the <em>state</em> that represents
            the data we are visualizing along with information about how it is to be
            displayed, such as the position of various visual components.

          <li>We pass the state to our <em>Diagram</em> component, which renders our
            virtual DOM, typically with the help of some sub-components.

          <li>As the user interacts with the diagram, the browser triggers <em>browser
            events</em>, which we handle by updating the state.

          <li>Our vDOM library notices the state change and builds a new virtual DOM
            by calling our Diagram component again.

          <li>
            The vDOM library then updates the browser's DOM to match the new virtual DOM.
        </ul>

        <p>
          This tutorial use's Preact's <code>useReducer</code> hook to implement this
          lifecycle.
        </p>

        <h2>Canvas and Diagram Space</h2>

        <p>
          In this step, our state consists of just the current zoom level and pan position
          that we update by hooking the <code>wheel</code> event.  Our Diagram component
          uses the state to render something like this:
        </p>

        <pre>
&lt;div class="zui-canvas" draggable=false&gt;
  &lt;div class="zui-diagram" style="transform: scale(1) translate(0,0); transform-origin: top left"&gt;
    &lt;!-- shapes go here --&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

        <p>
          The zoom and pan position are interpolated into the CSS transform on the <code>zui-diagram</code>
          element.  Using a CSS transform for this allows the browser to use the GPU to accelerate
          drawing our shapes.
        </p>

        <p>
          The CSS transform we use creates a coordinate system for the `div.diagram` element that's
          different from the coordinate system for the `div.canvas` element.  We will need to convert
          between these coordinate system to properly pan and zoom the diagram.   Note that the CSS
          `transform` propery applies its transformations is reverse order, implying the following the
          following relationship between \(x_c\) (the x-coordinate for a point in canvas space) and
          \(x_d\) (the x-coordinate for the point in diagram space).
        </p>

        $$ x_c = (x_d + x_{pan}) \cdot zoom $$

        $$ x_d = \frac{x_c}{zoom} - x_{pan} $$

        <p>
          The y-coordinates are similarly related.
        </p>

        <p>
          These equations come in handy when properly handling zoom changes.
          When we zoom, we want the zoom to happen around the current point of
          the cursor.  This requires is to adjust the pan simultaneously, such
          that the tip of the cursor in canvas space continues to align with
          the same point in diagram space after the zoom change.  Let
          \(x_{pan0}\) and \(zoom_0\) represent the pan and zoom before the
          change and \(x_{pan1}\) and \(zoom_1\) represent the pan and zoom
          after. Equating \(x_d\) before and after the change, we get the
          following.
        </p>

        $$ \frac{x_c}{zoom_1} - x_{pan1} = \frac{x_c}{zoom_0} - x_{pan0} $$

        $$ - x_{pan1} = \frac{x_c}{zoom_0} - x_{pan0} - \frac{x_c}{zoom_1} $$

        $$ x_{pan1} = x_{pan0} + \frac{x_c}{zoom_1} - \frac{x_c}{zoom_0}$$
